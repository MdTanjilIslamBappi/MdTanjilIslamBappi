## ðŸ‘‹ Good day! Nice to see you here ðŸ˜„


As a systems engineer passionate about servers, storage, and virtualization, I bring over ten years of experience designing and implementing enterprise IT solutions. 
My expertise in virtualization technologies such as VMware and Hyper-V and my deep understanding of storage systems, network infrastructure, and server hardware have allowed me to deliver successful client IT projects. I am a creative problem solver and a strong communicator, able to work effectively with stakeholders to drive technical excellence and ensure project success.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PowerCLI and Python

ðŸ¥³ Fun fact: I love to experiment with coffee brewing methods, and I love to travel.
